.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hc12mem
[ option | filename ] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hc12mem
is a tool for operating on Freescale HC12 MCU's internal memories
(EEPROM and FLASH). It can:
.PD 0
.PP
- load any program into HC12 RAM and execute it,
.PP
- erase, read, write EEPROM, set EEPROM protection,
.PP
- erase, read, write FLASH,
.PP
- secure and unsecure whole MCU.
.PD
.SH "SUPPORTED INTERFACES"
.PP
hc12mem can communicate with the target device using BDM link or serial port.
.PP
.B BDM POD
.PP
Using BDM link requires special interface device - so called BDM POD.
Currently hc12mem supports only single POD type - Kevin Ross's BDM12 POD.
It can be original one, or PODEX which is compatible with original BDM12
POD serial protocol. POD type must be specified using -i option, valid
arguments are:
.IP
.B bdm12pod
- original Kevin Ross's BDM12 POD, see
.I http://www.kevinro.com
.IP
.B podex-bug
- original Marek Peca's
significantly slow the communication down, see
.I http://www.duch.cz/podex/
.IP
.B podex
- PODEX with improved firmware, wih patches for memory access bugs
found in original design; this version works exactly the same as
original Kevin Ross's BDM12 POD, option
.B -i podex
is equivalent to
.B -i bdm12pod
For more details see
.I http://cml.mfk.net.pl/podex
.IP
.B podex-25
- special PODEX version dedicated for 25MHz target (expecially
MC9S12NE64). This interface doesn't require specifying target
oscillator frequency. For more details see
.I http://cml.mfk.net.pl/podex
.PP
.B BOOTLOADER (Freescale's LRAE via serial port)
.PP
hc12mem supports operations on target memory using Freescale's LRAE
(Load RAM And Execute) bootloader, using serial port connection
(SCI0 on target hardware). Prior to all operations, presence of LRAE
bootloader is required in target's FLASH memory. LRAE is
available for a wide selection of HCS12 MCUs. Source code, S-record
files and description can be obtained from Freescale as Application
Note - AN2546. This bootloader is supposedly loaded into new HCS12
MCUs as last stage of factory processing, thus some "fresh" parts straight
from Freescale should have this bootloader already in FLASH memory.
.PP
.B MONITOR (Freescale's serial monitor - AN2548)
.PP
hc12mem supports operations on target memory using Freescale's serial monitor
(AN2548). This monitor uses serial port connection (SCI0 on target hardware).
Prior to all operations, presence of serial monitor is required in target's
FLASH memory. Monitor is available for a wide selection of HCS12 MCUs.
Source code, S-record files and description can be obtained from Freescale
as Application Note - AN2548. Port of the source code to GNU tools is
available, see "SEE ALSO" section.
.SH "SUPPORTED MCUs"
.PP
Support for various HCS12 derivatives is dependent on target device
connection.
.PP
.B BDM
.PP
hc12mem running via BDM supports almost all HCS12 derivatives (not all
are tested, though, especially parts with multiple FLASH blocks are
not tested):
.PP
<MC9S12> A32, A64, A128, A256, A512,
C32, C64, C96, C128, GC16, GC32, GC64, GC96, GC128,
D32, D64, D128, D256, D512, E32, E64, E128, E256, H128, H256,
UF32, NE64.
.PP
.B LRAE BOOTLOADER
.PP
hc12mem using LRAE supports all derivatives that can run LRAE, according
to AN2546 (maybe some others too, if LRAE can work on them):
.PP
<MC9S12> A32, A64, A128, A256, A512, C32, C128,
D32, D64, D128, D256, D512, E128.
.PP
.B SERIAL MONITOR
.PP
hc12mem using serial monitor supports all derivatives that can run serial
monitor. AN2548 has variants of serial monitor for the following targets
(compiling dedicated version for other target is easy):
.PP
<MC9S12> C32, D32, D64, D128, D256, D512, E128, H256.
.PP
My port to GNU tools adds support for A64 and NE64.

.PD 0
.IP
This option is mandatory and must be specified exactly once.
.PD
.TP
.B -p <port>, --port <port>
Use given serial port for target connection. Port is a path to device special
file, typically
.I /dev/something
.TP
.B -b <bps>, --baud <bps>

.TP
.B -t <target>, --target <target>
Use given target description. Target description is a file with some key-value
pairs, determining configuration.
.I target
can be specified in two ways: direct file name (this file is used as target
description), or target nick name (target description file name is created by
appending
.I .doc
to the
.I target
argument, then looked up in program's data directory).
.IP
For example,
.B -t some_file_name.dat
will treat this file as target description, and
.B -t some_other_target
will look for
.I /usr/local/share/hc12mem/some_other_target.dat
file, if that's where program data files are located.
.TP
.B -o <freq>, --osc <freq>
Specify target device oscillator frequency.
.I freq
can be specified directly as value in Hz, or suffix [k|kHz|M|MHz] can be used,
for example these all are equivalent: -o 8000000, -o 8000kHz, -o 8MHz
.TP
.B -j <addr>, --start-address <addr>
Use this start address for program loaded into RAM, if this address is not
specified by S-record file.
.TP
.B -a <type>, --flash-address <type>

When not specified,
.B non-banked
addressing is used.
.PD
.TP

processing is according to occurence order:
.TP
.B -R, --reset <file>
Reset target into normal mode.
.TP
.B -U, --unsecure
Unsecure secured microcontroller. This means erasing EEPROM and FLASH
memories as part of the process !
.TP

Secure the microcontroller. This means disabling access to EEPROM and FLASH
memories, any further access requires unsecuring first.
.TP
.B -X <file>, --ram-run <file>
Load S-record file into RAM and execute. Addresses of data to load must
correspond to target MCU RAM area. Program is run from address supplied
in apropriate S-record, it can be overriden using -j option.

.B all
- protects whole EEPROM array
.PD 0
.IP
.B xxxB
- protects last xxx bytes of EEPROM array
.PD
.TP

.PP
Options specific for particular interfaces:
.TP
.B -Z, --keep-lrae
Option applicable for LRAE bootloader only - when erasing FLASH memory,
keep LRAE in memory (do not erase FLASH area containing LRAE image).
Default is to bulk erase whole memory, thus erasing LRAE.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
There are some common options that must be specified in most cases: interface
type, serial port, target type, target oscillator frequency. Almost every call
requires these, so for clarity they will be stated only once as an example,
and omitted in the following examples, substituted by [-ipto] symbol.
.PP
.B BDM
.PP
For BDM connection, we specify the following common options:
interface is PODEX, serial port for PODEX attachment
is /dev/uart0, target is MC9S12A64 MCU operating at 16MHz.
.B hc12mem
call usually requires some more action commands to do something specific,
but such call with these options only is convenient for verifying target
communication - it initializes the target, displays all the info and quits:
.RS
.PP
hc12mem -i podex -p /dev/uart0 -t mc9s12a64 -o 16MHz
.RE
.PP
Unsecure secured microcontroller:
.RS
.PP
hc12mem [-ipto] --unsecure
.RE
.PP
Secure unsecured microcontroller:
.RS
.PP
hc12mem [-ipto] --secure
.RE
.PP
Load some code into target RAM and execute:
.RS
.PP
hc12mem [-ipto] --ram-run some_code.s19
.RE
.PP
Read EEPROM contents:
.RS
.PP
hc12mem [-ipto] --eeprom-read eeprom_data.s19
.RE
.PP
Set EEPROM protection:
.RS
.PP
hc12mem [-ipto] --eeprom-protect all
.RE
.PP
Read data from FLASH memory and write it to S-record file, use Freescale
banked linear addresses, write all erased 0xff's to output file (default
is to skip them):
.RS
.PP
hc12mem [-ipto] -e --flash-address banked-linear --flash-read flash_data.s19
.RE
.PP
Write data from S-record file to FLASH memory (non-banked flat addressing,
option -a non-banked assumed by default):
.RS
.PP
hc12mem [-ipto] --flash-write flash_data.s19
.RE
.PP
Action options can be specified multiple times, they are executed in specified
order, for example - erase FLASH, write program into FLASH and reset target,
thus immediatelly starting program execution:
.RS
.PP
hc12mem [-ipto] --flash-erase --flash-write program.s19 --reset
.RE
.PP
.B LRAE BOOTLOADER (AN2546)
.PP
Using LRAE serial bootloader, we specify following common options:
.RS
.PP
hc12mem -i lrae -p /dev/uart0 -t mc9s12a64 -o 16MHz
.RE
.PP
Baud rate for serial connection is automatically calculated by hc12mem, using
supplied oscillator frequency as reference. You can override auto-selected baud
rate with -b <baud> option, if some other speed is preferred.
.PP
Load your program into target RAM, and execute it:
.RS
.PP
hc12mem [-ipto] --ram-run program.s19
.RE
.PP
Write your program into target FLASH, keeping LRAE in FLASH:
.RS
.PP
hc12mem [-ipto] --flash-erase --keep-lrae --flash-write program.s19
.RE
.PP
Bulk erase FLASH memory, load LRAE and your program:
.RS
.PP
hc12mem [-ipto] --flash-erase --flash-write lrae.s19 --flash-write program.s19
.RE
.PP
NOTES: reloading FLASH program using LRAE is tricky, because when your program
is loaded into FLASH, LRAE is not running anymore. Thus, if you want to reuse LRAE,
your program must have a way to enter LRAE on request, for example push button
tested as very first thing in your program or something like that.
Also, every hc12mem call using LRAE requires preceding manual target reset.
.PP
Writing program destined to be loaded into FLASH memory in coexistence with
LRAE bootloader has special requirements (memory layout, MCU initialization),
see Application Note AN2546 for more details.
.PP
.B SERIAL MONITOR (AN2548)
.PP
Using serial monitor, we specify following common options (oscillator frequency
is not required):
.RS
.PP
hc12mem -i sm -p /dev/uart0 -t mc9s12a64
.RE
.PP
Baud rate for serial connection is 115200bps by default. If you have special
version of serial monitor compiled with some other settings, you can override
auto-selected baud rate with -b <baud> option.
.PP
Using serial monitor, there's no way to erase it, except via BDM, and:
.PD 0
.PP
- erasing FLASH erases only parts of memory outside serial monitor
(--flash-erase and --flash-erase-unsecure do the same)
.PP
- erasing FLASH erases also EEPROM ! (this is how serial monitor implements
this)
.PP
- securing and unsecuring MCU is not supported
.PD
.PP
Erase EEPROM, write some initial data and protect upper 256 bytes of EEPROM:
.RS
.PP
hc12mem [-ipto] --eeprom-erase --eeprom-write eeprom.s19 --eeprom-protect 256B
.RE
.PP
Erase FLASH (EEPROM gets erased too), write your program and reset target (thus
starting your program):
.RS
.PP
hc12mem [-ipt] --flash-erase --flash-write program.s19 --reset
.RE
.PP
Writing program destined to be loaded into FLASH memory in coexistence with
serial monitor has special requirements (memory layout, MCU initialization),
see Application Note AN2548 for more details.
