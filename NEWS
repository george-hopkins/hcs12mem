hc12mem 1.3.2 [2007-04-10]

- fixed bug in setting extended speed (other than 1/2/4/8MHz) for new PODEX
  version using ATTINY2313
- added preliminary support for recognizing S12X chips

hc12mem 1.3.1 (2006.02.08)

- relaxed timing for PODEX - handshake timeout increased, because on slower
  computers or even with heavy task switching timeouts happened
- bug fix: FPROT was read directly from memory, thus when the MCU was secured,
  false readouts occured - now it is accessed via register, with proper
  FLASH bank selection
- bug fix: bits of FPROT were misinterpreted, depending on bits pattern
- non-programmed FLASH area detection has changed block threshold size from
  2 to 4 bytes, so less non-contiguous blocks are reported (2 bytes of 0xff
  were quite common in the code)

hc12mem 1.3 (2005.12.16)

- support for Daniel Malik's TBDML - Turbo BDM Light USB POD
  bulk USB transfers with TBDML are also supported, although not by default,
  because they are violating USB specification. To activate them, --tbdml-bulk
  option is required, giving faster data transfer rates (works under FreeBSD
  and MS Windows, linux rejects it, but Your Mileage May Vary)
- more improvements to reporting FLASH address ranges to program
- long options supported on MS Windows
- some minor bugfixes affecting all interfaces, so users of previous
  versions should upgrade even if new functionality is of no importance

hc12mem 1.2 (2005.11.23)

- support for Freescale's serial monitor - Application Note AN2548,
  using this monitor, hc12mem can:
  - erase,read,write,protect EEPROM
  - erase,read,write FLASH
  - reset target
  - no support for securing/unsecuring whole MCU
- detailed report for FLASH writing with list of address ranges defined
  for programming
- improved FLASH writing logic - skipping empty areas even if defined
  in S-record file

hc12mem 1.1 (2005.11.17)

- support for Freescale's LRAE (Load RAM And Execute) bootloader,
  see Application Note AN2546 from Freescale.
  LRAE currently can erase, read and write FLASH memory, with option to leave
  or erase LRAE itself
- support for much more chips - almost every HCS12 MCU is supported,
  but not all are tested, though. Especially parts with multiple FLASH
  blocks were not tested yet
- resolved some problems with serial port timing under unix systems
- changed option -V for --verify into -v
- included S-record files for target loadable RAM agents, so no more
  requirement for GNU gcc for hc11/12 for installation from sources

hc12mem 1.0 (2005.11.08)

- first version released
- support for Kevin Ross's BDM12 POD, Marek Peca's PODEX and my own
  improved version of PODEX
- supported targets: MC9S12A64, MC9S12NE64
- tested under FreeBSD, GNU/linux and MS Windows
